## Animations
There are two animations: 

On scroll:
Some elements will animate on scroll: this is done using an intersection observer in vanilla javascript and some CSS animations. 

Follow mouse:
There is a div which follows the mouse's pointer position using document.onpointermove. With some css animations to rotate and transform.  


## Accessability 
This website was built was accessability in mind. By default the website does have on-scroll animations: if you wish to disable these please use the preferes reduced motion setting within your operating system. 
Light house score:

(If you don't disable the on scroll animations using preferes reduced motion, the lighthouse test will fail)
